## You are on the `GroupAccessControl` tag

Use the dropdown above to choose a different tag. Available tags are:

* BasicSecurity - Default Spring Boot and Spring Security. No Stormpath yet.
* LockedDown - Default Stormpath Spring Security integration. All paths require authentication.
* BasicAccessControl - Require authentication for certain paths and have other paths publicly available.
* GroupAccessControl - Further protect the application by requiring membership in a Stormpath Group.

This demonstrates Stormpath's Spring Boot and Spring Security integration.
